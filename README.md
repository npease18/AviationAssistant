# AviationAssistant
A GUI for my Aviation Assistant device

This code is in no way perfect or the most pretty. In fact most of this code is rather shabby looking and in dire need of optimization. Perhaps I will look through optimization as time goes on but anyone willing to optimise the code itself are welcome to do so. Any improvements or additions to the codebase and features would be greatly appreciated!

This is created using the dump1090-mutability software but more on the references can be found in information.html.
